# Eat Da Burger

Eat Da Burger is an app that allows users to log burgers they would like to eat and have eaten. The user is welcome to add burgers, which will automatically show as not eaten. When the user clicks the "Devour it!" button, the burger shows that it has been eaten. Each burger, whether eaten or not, is stored in the MySQL database.

This project was created as an assignment for the Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin.
